# Rick and Morty with SvelteKit

Trying out SvelteKit with Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/) and trying to use sass as styling.

This is a simple example of how to use [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) with [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

## Getting started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd rick-and-morty-sveltekit
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5731](http://localhost:5731). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and the page will reload.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`.
